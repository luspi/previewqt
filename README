 FEATURES
----------

 PreviewQt is a very simple application for previewing a wide range of files. Its main aim is on speed, striving to provide a preview as instanteneously as possible. It tries to achieve this by being very lightweight and by the ability to sit idly in the background ready to show whatever is thrown at it.

 Supported file formats include:

 - More than 140 IMAGE FORMATS - A list of all possibly supported image formats can be found on the website for PhotoQt: https://photoqt.org/formats
 - All of the common VIDEO and AUDIO FORMATS
 - PHOTO SPHERES and 360 DEGREE PANORAMAS (that use equirectangular prohections)
 - MOTION PHOTOS, MICRO VIDEOS, and APPLE LIVE PHOTOS
 - PDF DOCUMENTS including page navigation
 - ARCHIVES (zip, tar.gz, rar, 7-zip) with the ability to explore its content
 - COMIC BOOKS (cbz, cbt, cbr, cb7) including page navigation
 - WEBSITES, including pre-processing with YT-DLP for directly streaming media

 It is also possible to set up an external application for the categories of files. With a shortcut or button it is possible to pass a previewed file on to the provided external application for further processing.

 COMPANION APPLICATIONS
------------------------

 There are some companion application to PreviewQt:

 1) There is a remote control application (called `PreviewQtRemote`), shipped as part of the PreviewQt source code, that is anothing but a small square that stays in the foreground and can be moved anywhere out of the way. Dropping any file on that square passes that file on to PreviewQt.
 2) If you are running KDE Plasma 6, there is a plasmoid that itegrates nicely into your desktop. Dropping any file on that plasmoid shows an immediate preview with basic interaction. Double clicking that preview open PreviewQt for further handling.
